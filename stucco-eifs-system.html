                        <h2>History of EIFS</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p class="text-sm-2 wow zoomInDown">
                        EIFS was developed in Europe after World War II and was initially used to retrofit masonry
                        walls. EIFS started to be used
                        in North America in the 1960s, and became very popular in the mid- 1970s due to the oil embargo
                        and the resultant
                        surge in interest in high energy efficiency wall systems such as EIFS provides. The use of EIFS
                        over
                        stud-and-sheathing framing instead of over solid walls is a technique used primarily in North
                        America.
                        EIFS is now used all over North America, and also in many other areas around the world,
                        especially in
                        Europe and the Pacific Rim. In North America, EIFS was initially used almost exclusively on
                        commercial,
                        masonry buildings. As of 1997 EIFS accounted for about 4% of the residential siding market and
                        12% of the
                        commercial siding market. In the late 1980s problems started developing due to water leakage in
                        EIFS-clad buildings.
                        This created an international controversy and numerous lawsuits. Critics argue that, while not
                        inherently more prone to water penetration than other exterior finishes, barrier-type EIFS
                        systems (non-water-managed systems) do not allow water that penetrates the building envelope to
                        escape.The EIFS industry has consistently maintained that the EIFS itself was not leaking, but
                        rather poor craftsmanship and bad architectural detailing at the perimeter of the EIFS was
                        causing the problems. As a result, building codes began mandating a drainage system for EIFS
                        systems on wood frame buildings and additional on-site inspection. Most homeowner insurance
                        policies cover EIFS and EIFS-like systems.[ Though there are some cases where insurance
                        companies may not offer coverage for EIFS several companies do.] Also, some facility owners have
                        found that EIFS systems that are installed at lower building levels are subject to vandalism, as
                        the material is soft and can be chipped or carved resulting in significant damage. If these
                        concerns exist, specifying heavier ounce reinforcing mesh can be the answer. Building to these
                        specifications can drastically increase the durability of the EIFS system. EIFS installation was
                        found to be a contributing factor in the multibillion-dollar problem known as the "Leaky condo
                        crisis" in southwestern British Columbia and the "Leaky homes" issue in New Zealand that emerged
                        separately in the 1980s and 1990s.

                                fasteners. Adhesives are commonly used to attach EIFS to gypsum board, cement board,
                                or concrete substrates. EIFS are attached with mechanical fasteners (specially designed
                                for this application) when installed over housewraps (sheet-good weather barriers) such
                                as are commonly used over wood sheathings. The supporting wall surface should be

                                (not "open framing") and flat.

                                    <p>Types of EIFS are defined by their materials and the existence/absence of a drainage
                                        plane. The EIFS Industry Members Association (EIMA) defines two classes of EIFS,
                                        Class PB (polymer based) identified as PB EIFS and Class PM (polymer modified) identified
                                        as PM EIFS. PB EIFS is the most common type in North America and historically used
                                        expanded polystyrene (EPS) insulation adhered to the substrate with fiberglass mesh
                                        embedded in a nominal 1/16 inch (1.6 mm) base coat which can receive additional layers
                                        of mesh and base coat for stronger impact resistance.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Other types of insulation board can include polyisocyanurate. PM EIFS use extruded polystyrene
                                        insulation (XEPS), and a thick, cementitious base coat applied over mechanically
                                        attached glass fiber reinforcing mesh. The system has joints similar to traditional
                                        stucco. PM EIFS have evolved to include different insulation materials and base coats.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The most common type of EIFS used today is the system that includes a drainage cavity,
                                        which allows any and all moisture to exit the wall. EIFS with drainage typically
                                        consists of the following components:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>An optional water-resistive barrier (WRB) that covers the substrate</li>
                                        <li>A drainage plane between the WRB and the insulation board that is most commonly achieved
                                            with vertical ribbons of adhesive applied over the WRB</li>
                                        <li>Insulation board typically made of expanded polystyrene (EPS) which is secured with
                                            an adhesive or mechanically to the substrate</li>
                                        <li>Glass-fiber reinforcing mesh embedded in the base coat</li>
                                        <li>A water-resistant base coat that is applied on top of the insulation to serve as
                                            a weather barrier
                                        </li>
                                        <li>A finish coat that typically uses colorfast and crack-resistant acrylic co-polymer
                                            technology
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>

                                <div class="col-md-12" style="text-align:justify">
                                    <p>If an EIFS with Drainage, or water-managed EIFS is installed, a water resistive barrier
                                        (aka a WRB) is first installed over the substrate (generally glass faced exterior-grade
                                        gypsum sheathing, oriented strand board (OSB) or plywood). The moisture barrier is
                                        applied to the entire wall surface with a mesh tape over joints and a liquid-applied
                                        membrane or a protective wrap like tyvek or felt paper. Then a drainage cavity is
                                        created (usually by adding some sort of space between the foam and the WRB). Then
                                        the other 3 layers, described above, are added. This type of EIFS is required by
                                        many building codes areas on wood frame construction, and is intended to provide
                                        a path for incidental water that may get behind the EIFS with a safe route back to
                                        the outside. The purpose is to preclude water from damaging the supporting wall.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Adhesives and finishes are water-based, and thus must be installed at temperatures well
                                        above freezing. Two types of adhesives are used with EIFS: those that contain Portland
                                        cement ("cementitious"), or do not have any Portland cement ("cementless"). Adhesives
                                        that contain Portland cement harden by the chemical reaction of the cement with water.
                                        Adhesives and finishes that are cementless harden by the evaporation of water. Adhesives
                                        come in two forms: The most common is in a plastic pail as a paste, to which Portland
                                        cement is added and as dry powders in sacks, to which water is added. Finishes come
                                        in a plastic pail, ready to use, like paint. EIFS insulation comes in individual
                                        pieces, usually 2' x 4', in large bags. The pieces are trimmed to fit the wall at
                                        the construction site.</p>
